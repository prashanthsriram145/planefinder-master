== Purpose

To provide a streamlined REST API of data captured by a local (remote) PlaneFinder.net node for consumption by other applications/services.

PlaneFinder.net is a service that, with the help of numerous small devices located around the globe, captures and displays aviation activity via transponders/ADSB-out/MLAT. This makes it useful at a macro level, but also useful (and just generally fascinating) at a micro level as well.
